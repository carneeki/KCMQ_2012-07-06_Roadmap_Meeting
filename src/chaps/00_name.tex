Other names were ruled out pretty quickly. No objectors to KCMQ, though not all
involved are 100\% convinced yet.

\subsection{Action Items}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Logo needs to be a simple vector of some description involving at most 4
colours, but multiple tones of colour are permissible. This is to keep printing
costs down, and to make the logo recogniseable.

Logo concepts include circuitry and tools to form letters for the acronym
``KCMQ'' with the motto being: ``Engineering Motto: Challenge Accepted''.
\end{itemize}
